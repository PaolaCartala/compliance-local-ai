SQLite-Based Priority Queue System for Demand Spike Management
SQLite-Based Priority Queue System for Demand Spike Management
Queue Architecture Overview
To ensure optimal performance during demand spikes and provide prioritized access based on organizational hierarchy, the Baker Group LLM solution implements a SQLite-based asynchronous request management system with role-based priority queuing. This architecture prevents GPU resource contention while maintaining responsive user experiences across different access levels.
Core Queue Components
SQLite Database Schema
Role-Based Priority System
Priority Queue Hierarchy
Asynchronous Request Processing Architecture
Request Flow Management
Python
class AsyncRequestManager:
def   init  (self, db_path: str):
self.db = sqlite3.connect(db_path, check_same_thread=False)
self.executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) # GPU capacity limit
self.active_requests = {} 6
async def submit_request(self, user_context: UserContext,
request_data: RequestData) -> str:
"""Submit request to priority queue"""
priority = PRIORITY_LEVELS[user_context.role] 11
# Check concurrent request limits
if await self._check_user_limits(user_context):
request_id = await self._queue_request(
user_context, request_data, priority
16	)
17
# Start processing if resources available
await self._try_process_next()
return request_id
else:
raise ResourceLimitExceeded("User concurrent request limit reached") 23
async def _process_request_queue(self):
"""Main queue processing loop"""
while True:
try:
# Get highest priority pending request
request = await self._get_next_request()
if request:
await self._execute_model_inference(request)
else:
await asyncio.sleep(1) # No requests, brief pause
except Exception as e:
logger.error(f"Queue processing error: {e}")
await asyncio.sleep(5) # Error recovery delay 37
Model Resource Management
Demand Spike Management
Load Balancing Strategies
Python
class DemandSpikeHandler:
def   init  (self, db_manager: SQLiteQueueManager):
self.db = db_manager
self.load_metrics = LoadMetrics() 5
async def handle_high_demand(self):
"""Implement demand spike mitigation strategies"""
queue_depth = await self.db.get_queue_depth() 9
if queue_depth > HIGH_LOAD_THRESHOLD:
# Enable aggressive prioritization
await self._enable_executive_only_mode()
13
# Implement request batching for efficiency
await self._enable_batch_processing()
16
# Notify administrators
await self._send_load_alert()
19
async def _enable_batch_processing(self):
"""Batch similar requests for efficiency"""
# Group document analysis requests
doc_requests = await self.db.get_pending_by_type('document')
if len(doc_requests) >= 3:
await self._create_batch_job(doc_requests)
26
# Group transcript processing requests
transcript_requests = await self.db.get_pending_by_type('transcript')
if len(transcript_requests) >= 5:
await self._create_batch_job(transcript_requests)
